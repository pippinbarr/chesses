_Chesses_ is a set of eight variations on the classic game of chess. Each variation tends to involve addition of an extra rule to the game, whether it's pieces obeying gravity, sliding with momentum, or mutually annihilating each other on capture. Across all variations, I'm hopefully it will allow non-players of chess to get a kick out of the game.
